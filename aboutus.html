<h1>The H. N. A. Animal Anti-Cruelty League</h1>
<h2>Learn More about Us!</h2>
<p>The HNA AACL is named for webmistress Sarah Bradash's older sister, Holly Nichole Adler, who, from the tender age of a few months old, to her passing at the age of three, was a lover of animals.</p> 
<p>She took particularly kindly to cats and dogs, chasing around whoever she could find at family parties.</p>
<p>If you would like to donate to a shelter in Holly's name, visit the websites of any of the associated shelters featured on our homepage, or email Sarah directly.</p>
