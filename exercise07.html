        <h1>Happy Cats Make for Happy People</h1>

      <p>In the grand scheme of history, cats have seemed to rule over both the animal and human kingdoms. Why? According to Petfinder, calico cats are no exception; they are perceived as a feistier breed- the likes with which, I, as a calico owner, vehemently disagree.<p>

    <p>See? All cats are sweet angels, like those pictured above and below! What say you to the nonsense of "Every cat I've ever met, has hated me?" I have been a cat mom since the tender age of toddler-hood (as I believe we had a cat when I was a baby), and cannot imagine life without the little scoundrels.</p>

    <p>For the unfortunate folks who love animals, but suffer from allergies, I have included plenty of links to animal shelters that are local to northwest Indiana (for folks who live in the area between Chicago and South Bend) that <i> need </i> donations. There have recently been an influx of animals to shelters, due to the pandemic and other mitigating factors; I encourage folks who are interested to foster wherever possible.</p>

    <p><b>Be sure to call all shelters to set up appointments, in the event of interest in any cats.</b></p> 
    <p><b>Most local shelters require appointments for purpose of patron and employee health and safety.</b></p>
