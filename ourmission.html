<blockquote>In thinking about what my sister would have wanted for a foundation named after her, I feel like Holly and her legacy shine through the number of animals we strive to help.
            She loved dogs, particularly our Aunt Gloria's spaniel, Lady (who was a puppy when Holly was little). Holly would want dogs like Lady, 
            and cats like any of my seven fur babies, to be able to find loving homes.</blockquote>
