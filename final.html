    <p>Living in the Chicago area presents folks with loads of opportunities to help local shelters.</p> 
    <p>In honour of the webmistress' sister, Holly (a fierce animal lover, as a child), we at the HNA AACL seeks to give residents of Chicagoland the opportunity to explore pet ownership, whilst also rescuing an animal from a life of destitution.</p> 
    <p>Our linked shelters include ICS in Westville, IN, ACS in Chicago, PCAS in Valparaiso, IN, and the AWL in Chicago.</p> 
    <p>Pictured below are some of our featured animals.</p>
